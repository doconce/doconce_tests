# Text with wrong doconce format

# TODO: fix this

A list followed by a code block works okay:

  * Third point
  * Fourth point
!bc cod
some verbatime stuff
!ec

=== Section heading before code is caught by the syntax check ===
label{my} idx{failure}

!bc
more verbatime stuff
!ec

Next we see if backslashes are detected: \label{mylab}\idx{youridx}
And a reference to \cite{mybook}.

__Paragraph before code is bad.__

# But here it could be fooled by a comment

!bc
More verbatim stuff.
!ec

Can we successfully say `__call__` and `__add__` and avoid having them as
bad paragraphs?

Figure with just an image and no caption must be handled.

FIGURE: [testfigs/wave1D]

Figure with label, but no caption.

FIGURE: [testfigs/wave1D] label{myl1}

Figure with no comma between filename and options, and wrong path must
give error.

FIGURE: [testfigs/wave1D, width=800]

Figure with math only in the caption, which causes sphinx to use an
empty figure name, is problematic.

FIGURE: [testfigs/wave1D, width=800] $a=50$

Figure with hyperlink in caption creates problems with latex and --device=paper
because the link becomes a footnote inside the caption.

FIGURE: [testfigs/wave1D, width=800] "Google": "https://google.com".

Movie/figure with nonexistent URL must give error messages.

MOVIE: [https://hplgit.github.io/INF5620/doc/pub/mov-wave/pulse2_in_two_media/movie99x9.ogg, width=800] $a=50$

Links with mix of verbatim and plain text is not good: "`myfile.py` file": "https://some.where.net/myfile.py".

More text...
# Comment before math is ok
!bt
\begin{align}
a &= b,  label{eq1}\\
a &= b,  label{eq2}
\end{align}
!et

# Comment before list
