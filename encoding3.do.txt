## Test of handling non-ASCII characters in DocOnce
Text with a name like Åsmund Ødegård works in general.
# #ifdef PREPROCESS
Verbatim blocks with non-ASCII text does not work for HTML, but it works
for LaTeX. The remedy for HTML is to read the file with UTF-8 encoding.

!bc
a = 1  # Value suggested by Åsmund Ødegård.
!ec
# #endif

# #ifdef MAKO
## trigger Mako through the FORMAT variable...
This block (in format ${FORMAT})
triggers use of `mako`. For all formats, `mako` has
problem with non-ASCII characters anywhere in the text. The remedy
for all formats is to read the file with UTF-8 encoding. With --debug
one can see the internal str/unicode representation of the text
through the various stages of the text transformation process.

## Mako fails whether plain text or verbatim block:
$b = 1$ is a value suggested by Åsmund Ødegård.
# #endif
