__|bquote__
A quote:

!bquote
Sayre's law states that
``in any dispute the intensity of feeling is inversely
proportional to the value of the issues at stake.'' <linebreak>
By way of corollary, it adds: <linebreak>
``That is why academic politics are so bitter.'' <linebreak>

__|bbox and |bt.__
!bbox
A generic equation

!bt
\[ f(x) = 0 \]
!et
must be solved by a numerical method, such as

 * Newton's method
 * The Bisection method
 * Fixed-point (Picard) iteration by rewriting $f(x)=x - g(x)$
 * The Secant method
!ebox

__|bwarning.__
!bwarning (large) Watch out for $\nabla\cdot\bm{u}=0$ equations
Divergence freedom is often problematic from a numerical point
of view.
