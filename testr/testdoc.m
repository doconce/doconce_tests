% 
% *Abstract.* This is a document with many test constructions for doconce syntax.
% It was used heavily for the development and kept for testing
% numerous constructions, also special and less common cases.
% 
% And exactly for test purposes we have an extra line here, which
% is part of the abstract.
% 
% % Cannot demonstrate chapter headings since abstract and chapter
% % are mutually exclusive in LaTeX
% 
%% Section 1
% 
% Here is a nested list:
% 
%   * item1
% 
%   * item2
% 
%   * item3 which continues on the next line to test that feature
% 
%   * and a sublist
% 
%     * with indented subitem1
% 
%     * and a subitem2
% 
% 
%   * and perhaps an ordered sublist
% 
%    # first item
% 
%    # second item, continuing on a new line
% 
% 
% *Here is a list with paragraph heading.* 
%   * item1
% 
%   * item2
% 
%% Here is a list with subsubsection heading
%   * item1
% 
%   * item2
% 
% !bquote
% Here are two lines that make up
% a block quote for testing _emphasized words_ and *boldface words*,
% also with hypens:
% _pre_-fix, post-_fix_, *pre*-fix, post-*fix*.
% !equote
% 
% Here are two references. Equation (ref{my:eq1}) is fine. Eq. (ref{my:eq1}) too.
% Even Equation (ref{my:eq1}) without the tilde.
% 
%% Subsection 1
% 
% % Refer to section/appendix etc. at the beginning of the line
% % and other special fix situations for HTML.
% 
% More text, with a reference back to
% the section "Section 1" and "Subsection 1", and further to the
% the sections "Subsection 1" and "URLs", which
% encourages you to do the tasks in "Problem 2: Flip a Coin" and "Exercise 10: Make references to projects and problems".
%  "Appendix: Just for testing; part I" and "Appendix: Just for testing; part II" are also nice elements.
% 
%% Test Section reference at beginning of line and after a sentence
% The section "Subsection 1" is fine.
% The section "URLs" too.
% 
% % sphinx code-blocks: pycod=python cod=fortran cppcod=c++ sys=console
% 
%% Computer code
% Let's do some copying from files too. First from subroutine up to the very end,
% 
%        subroutine test()
%        integer i
%        real*8 r
%        r = 0
%        do i = 1, i
%           r = r + i
%        end do
%        return
%  C     END1
%  
%        program testme
%        call test()
%        return
% and then just the subroutine,
%  
%        subroutine test()
%        integer i
%        real*8 r
%        r = 0
%        do i = 1, i
%           r = r + i
%        end do
%        return
% and finally the complete file with a plain text verbatim environment
% (|envir=ccq|):
%  C     a comment
%  
%        subroutine test()
%        integer i
%        real*8 r
%        r = 0
%        do i = 1, i
%           r = r + i
%        end do
%        return
%  C     END1
%  
%        program testme
%        call test()
%        return
% 
% Testing other code environments. First Python:
% 
%  !bc pycod
%  def f(x):
%      return x+1
%  !ec
% which gets rendered as
% 
%  def f(x):
%      return x+1
% 
% Test paragraph and subsubsection headings before
% before code.
% 
% *Paragraph heading before code.* 
%  import sys
%  sys.path.insert(0, os.pardir)
% 
%% Subsubsection heading before code
%  def h(z):
%      return z+1
% 
% Here is a program that is supposed to be interactive via
% Python Online Tutorial, but that service is not accessible
% for the present format.
% 
%  class Line:
%      def __init__(self, a, b):
%          self.a, self.b = a, b
%  
%      def __call__(self, x):
%          a, b = self.a, self.b
%          return a*x + b
%  
%  line = Line(2, 1)
%  y = line(x=3)
%  print(y)
% 
% Some more Python code (actually specified as a sage cell, but
% such cells are not supported by this format).
% 
%  a = 2
%  b = 3
%  print('a+b:', a + b)
%  
%  # In a sage cell we can also plot
%  from matplotlib.pyplot import *
%  from numpy import *
%  x = linspace(0, 4*pi, 101)
%  y = exp(-0.1*x)*cos(x)
%  plot(x, y)
%  xlabel('x'); ylabel('y')
%  show()
% 
% Then Cython (with -h option so it is hidden in html/sphinx):
% 
%  cpdef f(double x):
%      return x + 1
% 
% Standard Python shell sessions:
% 
%  >>> from numpy import linspace, sin
%  >>> # Some comment
%  >>> x = linspace(0, 2, 11)
%  >>> y = sin(x)
%  >>> y[0]
%  0
%  >>> import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
%  >>> plt.plot(x, y)
% 
% Similar IPython sessions:
% 
%  In [1]: from numpy import linspace, sin
%  In [2]: # Some comment
%  In [3]: x = linspace(0, 2, 11)
%  In [4]: y = sin(x)
%  In [5]: y[0]
%  Out[5]: 0
%  In [6]: import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
%  In [7]: plt.plot(x, y)
%  In [8]: a='multiple-\nline\noutput'
%  In [9]: a
%  Out[9]: 'multiple-\nline\noutput'
%  In [10]: print(a)
%  multiple-
%  line
%  output
% 
% Here is the interactive session again, but with |pyshell-t|.
% 
%  >>> from numpy import linspace, sin
%  >>> # Some comment
%  >>> x = linspace(0, 2, 11)
%  >>> y = sin(x)
%  >>> y[0]
%  0
%  >>> import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
%  >>> plt.plot(x, y)
% 
% % This one tests a + sign before a code environment
% C++:
%  #include <iostream>
%  
%  int main()
%  {
%     std::cout << "Sample output" << std::endl;
%     return 0
%  }
% % The next should get correctly typset in sphinx (cod is fcod)
% % It also tests emoji before code
% And a little bit of Fortran: :dizzy_face:
% 
%  !bc cod
%        subroutine midpt(x, length, a, b)
%        real*8 a, b, x
%        x = (a + b)/2
%        length = b - a
%        return
%        end
%  !ec
% which then is typeset as
% 
%        subroutine midpt(x, length, a, b)
%        real*8 a, b, x
%        x = (a + b)/2
%        length = b - a
%        return
%        end
% 
% HTML:
% 
%  <table>
%  <tr><td>Column 1</td><td>Column 2</td></tr>
%  <tr><td>0.67526 </td><td>0.92871 </td></tr>
%  <!-- comment -->
%  </table>
% 
% But inline HTML code is also important, like text that starts with
% |<a href="| (which can destroy the following text if not properly
% quoted).
% 
% Matlab with comments requires special typesetting:
% 
% Comment on the beginning of the line can be escaped by %%
if a > b
% Indented comment needs this trick
c = a + b
end
% 
% And here is a system call:
% 
%  Terminal> mkdir test
%  Terminal> cd test
%  Terminal> myprog -f
%  output1
%  output2
% 
% Any valid pygments lexer/language name can appear to, e.g.,
% 
%  !bc restructuredtext
%  =======
%  Heading
%  =======
%  
%  Some text.
%  !ec
% results in
% 
%  =======
%  Heading
%  =======
%  
%  Some text.
% 
% % Here goes hidden code.
% % Python can be treated by some formats, Fortran is always out.
% 
% 
% 
% Finally, |!bc do| supports highlighting of DocOnce source:
% 
%  ======= DocOnce test file =======
%  
%  ===== Computer code =====
%  
%  Inline verbatim code, as in `import numpy as np`, is allowed, as well as
%  code blocks:
%  
%  !bc pycod
%  from math import sin
%  
%  def f(x):
%      """Example on a function."""
%      return sin(x) + 1
%  
%  print(f(0))
%  !ec
%  
%  
%  ===== Mathematics =====
%  
%  Formulas can be inline, as in $\nabla\cdot\bm{u} = 0$, or typeset
%  as equations:
%  
%  !bt
%  \begin{align*}
%  \nabla\cdot\bm{u} &= 0,\\ 
%  \bm{u} &= \nabla\phi .
%  \end{align*}
%  !et
%  
%  === Subsubsection heading ===
%  
%  DocOnce files can have chapters, sections, subsections, and subsubsections.
%  
%  __Paragraph heading.__ Paragraphs may have headings.
% 
% It is time to test |verbatim inline font| especially with |a newline
% inside the text| and an exclamation mark at the end: |BEGIN|! For
% spellcheck, test |a verbatim expression| in |another| in a |third|.
% Also test exclamation mark as in |!bc| and |!ec| as well as |a != b|.
% Also test backslashes and braces like |\begin|, |\begin{enumerate}|,
% |\end{this}\end{that}|, and |{something \inside braces}|.
% 
% The following attempt to exemplify colored text does not work in
% format matlabnb.
% Here is some red color and an attempt to write with
% green color containing a linebreak
% code. Some formats will only display 
% this correctly when |html| 
% is the output format.
% But here some more running text is added which is not part of
% the previous blocks with line breaks.
% 
%% Running OS commands
%  Terminal> python -c 'print("Testing\noutput\nfrom\nPython.")'
%  Testing
%  output
%  from
%  Python.
% 
%% Footnotes
% Here is a test of footnotes [^footnote], which are handy in text.
% They are used in different flavors, now in
% 
%  * list items (note below that footnotes work after math, verbatim, and URLs - bin fact old and emphasize too!)
% 
%  * even with math $\nabla^2u$[^math1]
% 
%  * and code |h[i] += 1|[^code] (_must_ have space between inline code and footnote!)
% 
%  * and links <https://google.com>[^google-search]
% 
% which gives flexibility in writing.
% This is the third[^example-of-the-third-footnote] example.
% 
%   [^footnote]: Typesetting of the footnote depends on the format.
% Plain text does nothing, LaTeX removes the
% definition and inserts the footnote as part of the LaTeX text.
% reStructuredText and Sphinx employ a similar type of typesetting
% as Extended Markdown and DocOnce, and in HTML we keep the same
% syntax, just displayed properly in HTML.
% [^math1]: Math footnotes can be dangerous since it
% interferes with an exponent.
% [^code]: One-line footnote.
% 
% [^google-search]: <google.com> is perhaps the most famous
% web site today.
% 
% Here is some more text before a new definition of a footnote that was
% used above.
% 
% !bnotice Non-breaking space character
% This paragraph aims to test non-breaking space character <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Non-breaking_space>, and a typical
% example where this is needed is in physical units: 7.4 km is traveled
% in $7.4/5.5\approx 1.345$ s.  Also check that a link <https://google.com> is
% not broken across lines (drag the browser window to test this).
% (On the other hand, the tilde is used in
% computer code, e.g., as in |[~x for x in y]| or in |y=~x|, and should
% of course remain a tilde in those contexts.)
% !enotice
% 
%% Subsection 2: Testing figures
% 
% Test of figures. In particular we refer to Figure ref{fig:impact} in which
% there is a flow.
% 
% <<testfigs/wave1D.png>>
% 
% Figures without captions are allowed and will be inlined.
% 
% <<testfigs/wave1D.png>>
% 
% % Test multi-line caption in figure with sidecap=True
% 
% Here is figure ref{myfig} with a long (illegal) multi-line caption
% containing inline verbatim text:
% 
% <<testfigs/wave1D.png>>
% 
% % Must be a blank line after MOVIE or FIGURE to detect this problem
% 
% Test URL as figure name:
% 
% <<https://raw.github.com/doconce/doconce/master/doc/src/blog/f_plot.png>>
% 
% % Test wikimedia type of files that otherwise reside in subdirs
% 
% *Remark.* Movies are tested in separate file |movies.do.txt|.
% 
% % Somewhat challenging heading with latex math, \t, \n, ? and parenthesis
% 
%% The $\theta$ parameter (not $\nabla$?)
% 
% Functions do not always need to be advanced, here is one
% involving $\theta$:
!bc
%  def f(theta):
%      return theta**2
% 
% *More on $\theta$.* Here is more text following headline with math.
% 
% Newcommands must also be tested in this test report:
% $\frac{1}{2}$, ${1/2}$, $\pmb{x}$, $\frac{Du}{dt}$,
% both inline and in block:
% 
% $$\frac{Du}{dt} &= 0\nonumber \\  \frac{1}{2} &= {1/2} \\  \frac{1}{2}\pmb{x} &= \pmb{n}$$
% 
% Or with align with label and numbers:
% 
% $$\frac{Du}{dt} &= 0  \\  \frac{1}{2} &= {1/2} \\  \frac{1}{2}\pmb{x} &= \pmb{n}$$
% 
% % Must test more complicated align and matrix compositions
% % where DocOnce inserts auto-numbered labels etc.
% 
% First one numbered (automatically):
% 
% $$\begin{pmatrix} G_2 + G_3 & -G_3 & -G_2 & 0 \\  -G_3 & G_3 + G_4 & 0 & -G_4 \\  -G_2 & 0 & G_1 + G_2 & 0 \\  0 & -G_4 & 0 & G_4 \end{pmatrix} &= \begin{pmatrix}  v_1 \\   v_2 \\   v_3 \\   v_4 \end{pmatrix} + \cdots   \\  \begin{pmatrix}  C_5 + C_6 & -C_6 & 0 & 0 \\   -C_6 & C_6 & 0 & 0 \\   0 & 0 & 0 & 0 \\   0 & 0 & 0 & 0 \end{pmatrix}   &= \frac{d}{dt}\begin{pmatrix}  v_1 \\   v_2 \\   v_3 \\   v_4 \end{pmatrix} + \begin{pmatrix}  0 \\   0 \\   0 \\   -i_0 \end{pmatrix} \nonumber  \end{align}$$
% 
% Second numbered (automatically):
% 
% $$\begin{pmatrix} G_1 + G_2\\  -G_3 & G_4 \end{pmatrix} &= \begin{pmatrix}  v_1 \\   v_2 \end{pmatrix} + \cdots\nonumber  \\  \left(\begin{array}{ll} y & 2\\  2 & 1 \end{array}\right) \left(\begin{array}{ll} 0 \\ x \end{array}\right) &= \begin{pmatrix} A \\ B \end{pmatrix}  \end{align}$$
% 
% Both numbered, with label by the user:
% 
% $$\begin{pmatrix} G_1 + G_2\\  -G_3 & G_4 \end{pmatrix} &= \begin{pmatrix}  v_1 \\   v_2 \end{pmatrix} + \cdots  \\   \left(\begin{array}{ll} y & 2\\  2 & 1 \end{array}\right) \left(\begin{array}{ll} 0 \\ x \end{array}\right) &= \begin{pmatrix} A \\ B \end{pmatrix} \end{align}$$
% Now we refer to Equations (mymatrix:eq1)-(mymatrix:eq2).
% 
%% Custom Environments
% 
% Here is an attempt to create a theorem environment via Mako
% (for counting theorems) and comment lines to help replacing lines in
% the |.tex| by proper begin-end LaTeX environments for theorems.
% Should look nice in most formats!
% 
% % begin theorem
% 
% *Theorem 5.* Let $a=1$ and $b=2$. Then $c=3$.
% % end theorem
% 
% % begin proof
% *Proof.* Since $c=a+b$, the result follows from straightforward addition.
% $\Diamond$
% % end proof
% 
% As we see, the proof of Theorem 5 is a modest
% achievement.
% 
%% Tables
% 
% % index with comma could fool sphinx
% 
% Let us take this table from the manual:
% 
% <table class="dotable" border="1">
% <thead>
% <tr><th align="center">time</th> <th align="center">velocity</th> <th align="center">acceleration</th> </tr>
% </thead>

% The DocOnce source code reads
%  
%    |--------------------------------|

%% User-defined environments
% 
% The example in the section "Example 1: A test function" demonstrates how to write a test function.
% That is, a special test function for a function |add| appears in
% the example in the section "Example 1: A test function".
%

% Suppose we want to write a test function for checking the
% implementation of a Python function for addition.

%% URLs
% 
% Testing of URLs: hpl's home page hpl <https://folk.uio.no/hpl>, or
% the entire URL if desired, <https://folk.uio.no/hpl>.  Here is a
% plain file link <testdoc.do.txt>, or <testdoc.do.txt>, or

% newline <testdoc.do.txt>. Can test spaces with the link with word
% too: hpl <https://folk.uio.no/hpl> or hpl <https://folk.uio.no/hpl>. Also |file:///| works: link to a
% file <file:///home/hpl/vc/doconce/doc/demos/manual/manual.html> is
% fine to have. Moreover, "loose" URLs work, i.e., no quotes, just
% the plain URL as in <https://folk.uio.no/hpl>, if followed by space, comma,
% colon, semi-colon, question mark, exclamation mark, but not a period
% (which gets confused with the periods inside the URL).
% 
% Mail addresses can also be used: hpl@simula.no <mailto:hpl@simula.no>, or just a mail link <mailto:hpl@simula.no>, or a raw <mailto:hpl@simula.no>.
% 
% Here are some tough tests of URLs, especially for the |latex| format:
% Newton-Cotes <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Newton%E2%80%93Cotes_formulas> formulas
% and a good book <https://www.springer.com/mathematics/computational+science+%26+engineering/book/978-3-642-23098-1>. Need to test
% Newton-Cotes with percentage in URL too:
% <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Newton%E2%80%93Cotes_formulas>
% and <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Newton-Cotes#Open_Newton.E2.80.93Cotes_formulae> which has a shebang.
% 
% For the |--device=paper| option it is important to test that URLs with
% monospace font link text get a footnote
% (unless the |--latex_no_program_footnotelink|
% is used), as in this reference to
% decay_mod <https://github.com/hplgit/INF5620/tree/gh-pages/src/decay/experiments/decay_mod.py>, ball1.py <https://tinyurl.com/pwyasaa/formulas.ball1.py>,
% and ball2.py <https://tinyurl.com/pwyasaa/formulas.ball2.py>.
% 
% % Comments should be inserted outside paragraphs (because in the rst
% % format extra blanks make a paragraph break).
% 
% % Note that when there is no https: or file:, it can be a file link
% % if the link name is URL, url, "URL", or "url". Such files should,
% % if rst output is desired, but placed in a |_static*| folder.
% 
% More tough tests: repeated URLs whose footnotes when using the
% |--device=paper| option must be correct. We have
% google <https://google.com>, google <https://google.com>, and
% google <https://google.com>, which should result in exactly three
% footnotes.
% 
% % !split and check if these extra words are included properly in the comment
% 
%% LaTeX Mathematics
% 
% Here is an equation without label using backslash-bracket environment:
% $$a = b + c$$
% 
% or with number and label, as in Equation (my:eq1), using the equation environment:
% 
% $${\partial u\over\partial t} = \nabla^2 u$$
% 
% We can refer to this equation by Equation (my:eq1).
% 
% Here is a system without equation numbers, using the align-asterisk environment:
% 
% $$\begin{align*} \pmb{a} &= \pmb{q}\times\pmb{n} \\  b &= \nabla^2 u + \nabla^4 v \end{align*}$$

% Print out "tail" or "head" for each flip and
% let the program count the number of heads.
% 
% % --- begin hint in exercise ---
% 
% *Hint 1.* Use |r = random.random()| and define head as |r <= 0.5|.

% 
% % --- begin answer of exercise ---
% *Answer.* If the |random.random()| function returns a number $<1/2$, let it be
% head, otherwise tail. Repeat this $N$ number of times.

%% Project 5: Explore Distributions of Random Circles
% 
% % keywords = ipynb
% 
% The formula for a circle is given by
% 
% $$x &= x_0 + R\cos 2\pi t, \\  y &= y_0 + R\sin 2\pi t,$$
% where $R$ is the radius of the circle, $(x_0,y_0)$ is the
% center point, and $t$ is a parameter in the unit interval $[0,1]$.
% For any $t$, $(x,y)$ computed from Equations (circle:x)-(circle:y)
% is a point on the circle.
% The formula can be used to generate |n| points on a circle:
% 
%  import numpy as np
%  
%  def circle(R, x0, y0, n=501):
%      t = np.linspace(0, 1, n)
%      x = x0 + R*np.cos(2*np.pi*t)
%      y = y0 + R*np.sin(2*np.pi*t)
%      return x, y
%  
%  x, y = circle(2.0, 0, 0)
% 
% % Often in an exercise we have some comments about the solution
% % which we normally want to keep where they are.
% 
% The goal of this project is to draw $N$ circles with random
% center and radius. Plot each circle using the |circle| function
% above.

% Version control systems allow you to record the history of files
% and share files among several computers and collaborators in a
% professional way. File changes on one computer are updated or
% merged with changes on another computer. Especially when working
% with programs or technical reports it is essential
% to have changes documented and to
% ensure that every computer and person involved in the project
% have the latest updates of the files.
% Greg Wilson' excellent Script for Introduction to Version Control <https://software-carpentry.org/2010/07/script-for-introduction-to-version-control/> provides a more detailed motivation why you will benefit greatly
% from using version control systems.

% !esummary
% 
% Projects that you want to share among several computers or project
% workers are today most conveniently stored at some web site "in the
% cloud" and updated through communication with that site. I strongly
% recommend you to use such sites for all serious programming and
% scientific writing work - and all other important files.
% 
% The simplest services for hosting project files are Dropbox <https://dropbox.com> and Google Drive <https://drive.google.com>.
% It is very easy to get started with these systems, and they allow you
% to share files among laptops and mobile units with as many users as
% you want. The systems offer a kind of version control in that the
% files are stored frequently (several times per minute), and you can go
% back to previous versions for the last 30 days. However, it is
% challenging  to find the right version from the past when there are
% so many of them.
% 
% More seriously, when several people may edit files simultaneously, it
% can be difficult detect who did what when, roll back to previous
% versions, and to manually merge the edits when these are
% incompatible. Then one needs more sophisticated tools than Dropbox or
% Google Drive: project hosting services with true version control
% systems.  The following text aims at providing you with the minimum
% information to started with such systems. Numerous other tutorials
% contain more comprehensive material and in-depth explanations of the
% concepts and tools.
% 
% The idea with project hosting services is that you have the files
% associated with a project in the cloud. Many people may share these
% files.  Every time you want to work on the project you explicitly
% update your version of the files, edit the files as you like, and
% synchronize the files with the "master version" at the site where the
% project is hosted.  If you at some point need to go back to a
% version of the files at some particular point in the past,
% this is an easy operation. You can also use tools to see
% what various people have done with the files in the various versions.
% 
% All these services are very similar. Below we describe how you get
% started with Bitbucket, GitHub, and Googlecode. Launchpad works very
% similarly to the latter three. All the project hosting services have
% excellent introductions available at their web sites, but the recipes
% below are much shorter and aim at getting you started as quickly as
% possible by concentrating on the most important need-to-know steps.
% The Git tutorials we refer to later in this document contain more
% detailed information and constitute of course very valuable readings
% when you use version control systems every day. The point now is
% to get started.

% 
% Projects that you want to share among several computers or project
% workers are today most conveniently stored at some web site "in the
% cloud" and updated through communication with that
% site. [hpl's semi opinion 1: not sure if in the cloud is
% understood by
% all.] I strongly recommend you to use such sites for all serious
% programming and scientific writing work - and all other important
% files.
% 
% The simplest services for hosting project files is Dropbox. [mp 2: Simply go to <https://dropbox.com> and watch the video. It explains
% how files, like |myfile.py|, perhaps containing much math, like
% $\partial u/\partial t$, are easily communicated between machines.] It
% is very easy to get started with Dropbox, and it allows you to share
% files among [hpl 3: laptops and mobile units -> computers, tablets,
% and phones].

%% Appendix: Testing headings ending with |verbatim inline|
% 
% The point here is to test 1) |verbatim| code in headings, and 2)
% ending a heading with verbatim code as this triggers a special
% case in LaTeX.
% 
% We also test mdash---used as alternative to hyphen without spaces around,
% or in quotes:
% 
% !bquote
% _Fun is fun_.---Unknown.
% !equote
% 
% The ndash should also be tested - as in the Hanson - Nilson equations
% on page 277 - 278.
% 
% And finally, what about admons, quotes, and boxes? They are tested
% in a separate document: |admon.do.txt|.

% is at the end with only one newline.
