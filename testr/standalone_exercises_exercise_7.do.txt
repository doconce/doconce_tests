# Another minimalistic exercise

Just some text. And some math saying that $e^0=1$ on a single line,
to test that math block insertion is correct:

!bt
\[ \exp{(0)} = 1 \]
!et

And a test that the code `lambda x: x+2` is correctly placed here:

!bc
lambda x: x+2
!ec


# Have some comments at the end of the exercise to see that
# the Filename: ... is written correctly.
