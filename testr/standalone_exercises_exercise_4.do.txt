TITLE: Project 4: Compute a Probability

# Minimalistic exercise


What is the probability of getting a number between 0.5 and 0.6 when
drawing uniformly distributed random numbers from the interval $[0,1)$?


At the end we have a list because that caused problems in LaTeX
in previous DocOnce versions:

 o item1
 o item2


__Hint.__
To answer this question empirically, let a program
draw $N$ such random numbers using Python's standard `random` module,
count how many of them, $M$, that fall in the interval $(0.5,0.6)$, and
compute the probability as $M/N$.
