*Abstract.* This is a document with many test constructions for doconce syntax.
It was used heavily for the development and kept for testing
numerous constructions, also special and less common cases.

And exactly for test purposes we have an extra line here, which
is part of the abstract.

.. Cannot demonstrate chapter headings since abstract and chapter

.. are mutually exclusive in LaTeX
