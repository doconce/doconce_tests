[1m--latex_admon=...                  [0m [94mType of admonition in LaTeX: 
  colors1: (inspired by the NumPy User Guide) applies different colors for the different admons with an embedded icon; 
  colors2: like `colors1` but the text is wrapped around the icon; 
  mdfbox: rounded boxes with a optional title and no icon (default); 
  graybox2: box with square corners, gray background, and narrower than mdfbox, if code it reduces to something like mdfbox (mdframed based); the summary admon is in case of A4 format only half of the text width with text wrapped around (effective for proposals and articles); 
  grayicon: box with gray icons and a default light gray background; 
  yellowicon: box yellow icons and a default light yellow background; 
  paragraph:  plain paragraph with boldface heading. 
  Note: the colors in mdfbox and other boxes can customized.[0m
[1m--latex_admon_color=...            [0m [94mThe color to be used as background in admonitions. A single value applies to all admons: either rgb tuple (--latex_admon_color=0.1,0.1,0.4) or saturated color ('--latex_admon_color=yellow!5' - note the quotes needed for bash). 
  Multiple values can be assigned, one for each admon (all admons must be specified): '--latex_admon_color=warning:darkgreen!40!white;notice:darkgray!20!white;summary:tucorange!20!white;question:red!50!white;block:darkgreen!40!white'   If --latex_admon=mdfbox, the specification above with color1!X!color2 will automatically trigger 2*X as the background color of the frametitle.
  There are predefined multiple values, e.g., --latex_admon_color=colors1 gives red warnings, blue notice, orange questions, green summaries and yellow blocks, automatically adjusted with darker frametitles. 
  If --latex_admon=mdfbox, the background of the title and the color of the border of box can also be customized by direct editing. For example, a dark blue border and light blue title background is obtained by editing the .tex file as 
  doconce replace 'linecolor=black,' 'linecolor=darkblue,' mydoc.tex 
  doconce subst 'frametitlebackgroundcolor=.*?,' 'frametitlebackgroundcolor=blue!5,' mydoc.tex
  Actually, this particular (and common) edit is automatically done by the option --latex_admon_color=bluestyle
  --latex_admon_color=yellowstyle (the latter has color yellow!5 instead and yellow!20 for the border)[0m
[1m--latex_admon_title_no_period      [0m [94mBy default, a period is added to title admons that do not have a period, question mark, or similar. This option prevents adding a period such that the title acts like a heading.[0m
[1m--latex_admon_envir_map=...        [0m [94mMapping of code envirs to new envir names inside admons, e.g., to get a different code typesetting inside admons. This is useful if admons have a special color and the color background of code blocks does not fit will with the color background inside admons. Then it is natural to use a different verbatim code style inside admons. If specifying a number, say 2, as in --latex_admon_envir_map=2, an envir like pycod gets the number appended: pycod2. One can then in --latex_code_style= or in doconce ptex2tex or ptex2tex specify the typesetting of pycod2 environments. Otherwise the specification must be a mapping for each envir that should be changed inside the admons: --latex_admon_envir_map=pycod-pycod_yellow,fpro-fpro2 (from-to,from-to,... syntax).[0m
